# AccessGranted

Languages/Technologies Used: Java, XML, Arduino Uno, Fingerprint scanner, C++

The Access Granted Project is an application that takes input from a user in the form of a fingerprint attached to a ring and uses it as an input in the form of morse code. Each different finger represented a character in morse code. We used an arduino uno to implement the hardware, Android studio to the make the android app. The app aimed to help people with disabilities communicate through morse code. We futher implemented this technology to have applications such as in education - iClicker student voting system or even controlling your smart home device.
